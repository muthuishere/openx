# openx - Stop Clicking Around, Start Coding

**Tired of this?**
- `‚åò+Space` ‚Üí "VS Code" ‚Üí `Enter` ‚Üí wait... ‚Üí click on project folder
- Opening browser ‚Üí typing `http://localhost:3000` ‚Üí opening Postman ‚Üí finding that API collection
- Switching between 5 different apps just to start coding
- Different commands/paths on Mac vs Linux vs Windows
- Writing the same app-launching script for every project

**Just do this instead:**
```bash
openx vscode . && openx chrome && openx postman
```

**You can also add it to your workflow:**
```json
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "launch-my-env": "openx vscode . && openx chrome && openx postman"
  }
}
```

Cross-platform GUI app launcher that actually works the same everywhere. No more clicking, no more platform-specific scripts.
